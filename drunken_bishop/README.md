# Drunken Bishop algorithm

This is my attempt at making the OpenSSHfingerprint visualization algorithm.

## Initial thoughts
Could solve this with ANSI but that's probably overcomplicating it MORE than necessary.
Could simulate the whole thing first using a multi-dimensional array and toggling the 0s to record how many times they were visited. Kind of a matrix?
